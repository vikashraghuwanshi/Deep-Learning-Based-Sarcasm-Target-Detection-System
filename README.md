# Sarcasm_Target_Detection
The dataset.csv file contains snippets(book_text) and probable targets.
This dataset file is then preprocessed and preprocessed data is present in pre_processed_dataset.csv file which contains 4 columns:
1. left_context
2. right_context
3. candidate_words
4. target_status

The Data_preparation.ipynb file does the embedding of the left_context, right_context and candidate_words based on preloaded embeddings contained in file crawl-300d-2M.vec.
The crawl-300d-2M.vec file can be downloaded from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html
These features are dumped in a pickle file.

The Socio_Linguistic_Feature_Extraction.ipynb file  extracts the POS, NER, Empath features using the Standford NER API and Standford POS API. 
The empath is a python module.
These two files cand be downloaded from below links:
1.Standford NER API: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html#Download (3.9.2 version is used in this code)
2.Standford POS API: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml (3.9.2 version is used in this code)
These fetures are dumped in a pickle file.

The Model.ipynb file does the training and k-cross validation of the features extracted from the previous file.
